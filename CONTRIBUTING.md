# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving this tool. This app is only built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so contributing should be very beginner-friendly.

## Suggested improvements

Currently I'm planning on making improvements that can be grouped in the following general areas:

- Localization: It would be great to have the app translated to other languages.
- Context: Ideally the app would have a bit more of information on color deficiencies and how to design visuals with acessibility in mind, with links to useful resources.
- Testing: I haven't had a lot of people test this tool, so testing and opening bug reports would be extremely useful.
- Design: I'm open to restyling the app to make it easier on the eyes and maybe also more user-friendly (styling the download button is what first comes to mind). Right now I'm not using any frameworks, it's purely CSS (with some destyling to reset things). The app uses CSS Grid for the layout.
- Features: Ideally the app will include an additional page to add the Context item (information and related links), so that link would have to be included in the header in a menu that is mobile-friendly as well.
