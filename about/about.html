                        Color vision is the ability to perceive the different spectrums of light. This is done by light entering 
                        the eye and translated via the photoreceptors at the back of the eye. A normal human eye are sensitive to 
                        three different wavelengths of light. Hence why humans are known to have a trichomatric color vision. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Colour visions in humans can be split into nine types within four categories. Trichromacy is one of the nine types 
                        - those with normal visions. The other eight are known color vision blindness. Color vision blindness are either 
                        hereditary, can be caused by disease or injury.

                    <p>
                        It is possible for color blindness to be passed down from parents to their children. Red-green
                        color blindness is more common in men. This does not mean that women are not susceptible to color blindness.
                        Other categories of color blindness affects both male and female equally.

                        Other than hereditary color blindness, a person can also get color blindness from 
                        diseases and injuries. 
                        Direct injuries to the eye or to the brain may cause a person to get color blindness.
                        Some diseases such as glaucoma and multiple scelorosis that may cause harm to the eye directly
                        or indirectly could also cause color blindness.
